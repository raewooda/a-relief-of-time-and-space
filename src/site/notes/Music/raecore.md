A bit ago some friends and I decided to do a group listen of an [album a day](https://1001albumsgenerator.com/) from the [1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1001_Albums_You_Must_Hear_Before_You_Die) book series. People eventually got burned out on the project due to the preponderance of "Rolling Stone" taste: the type of white boy seal of approval that flattens music to a few acceptable genres with the occasional exceptional diversity inclusion. 

Lucky for me, my personal taste was developed in the Pitchfork mines of aughts. My pain threshold for navel-grazing and mediocrity is high. If I am being honest, I legitimately liked most of what we listened to, while still acknowledging the heterogeneity.

This is all to say, at some point, there emerged a fairly clear pattern in which artists in this prescribed oeuvre resonated with me. And thus "raecore" was discovered. A year later I did a PowerPoint presentation, mostly as a bit, that was the definitive guide to raecore:

The biggest laugh of the presentation was the [[Music/PTSD\|P.T.S.D.]] acronym reveal: "An entirely new acronym that does not at all explain my relationship to music". One of the "jokes" that isn't really a joke.
