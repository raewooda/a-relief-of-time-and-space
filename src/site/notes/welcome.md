# hello, and welcome

I'm not sure how you got here but I'm glad you did. This is my personal digital garden, a collection of fragments that might grow into something more. 

A programming note: Don't expect fully formed thoughts. If this collection coalesces into a coherent whole, I welcome it. However, I'm primarily here to free myself from the restrictions of perfectionism. 

Do expect this garden to become overgrown and wild with abandoned interests, musings, and fixations.

# about me

I'm Rae. I'm trans masc. I'm a technical writer. That's all you need to know for now.

# about my interests

In no particular order and subject to change:

[^1]: TBD. As a lapsed English major this is perhaps a theoretical interest.
