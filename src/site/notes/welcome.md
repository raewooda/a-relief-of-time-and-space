# hello, and welcome

I'm not sure how you got here but I'm glad you did. This is my personal digital garden, a collection of fragments that might grow into something more. 

A programming note: Don't expect fully formed thoughts. If this collection coalesces into a coherent whole, I welcome it. However, I'm primarily here to free myself from the restrictions of perfectionism. 

Do expect this garden to become overgrown and wild with abandoned interests, musings, and fixations.
